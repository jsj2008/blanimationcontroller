BLAnimationController is a simple class that can bring UIView Animation-style animations to any component in your project.  It provides the mechanism that gives you timed updates with various animation curves for the desired amount of time.

It is heavily based on UIView Animation controls, so if you know that interface already, you'll be able to easily use these.
